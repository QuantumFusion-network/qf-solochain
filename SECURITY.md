# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are at the very beginning of our journey (as of March 2025). While we build on the shoulders of giants like Rust and
Polkadot SDK, following industry standards and best practices, it would be overly optimistic to expect a completely
secure system at this stage. Our goal is to communicate transparently about any issues and address them swiftly and
carefully.

If you discover a vulnerability or have a security concern, please report it to <security@qfnetwork.xyz>. A detailed
explanation, including reproduction steps or a reference to the vulnerability source code, would be greatly appreciated!

## Supported Versions
