## Building From Source

> This section assumes that the developer is running on either macOS or Debian-variant operating system. For Windows,
although there are ways to run it, we recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
or a virtual machine.

1. Install Polkadot SDK dependencies following https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/.

2. Clone the repository and build the node binary.

    ```console
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/QuantumFusion-network/qf-solochain.git
    cd qf-solochain
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. Inspect available subcommands.

    ```console
    ./target/release/qf-node --help
    ```

4. Run a local node in dev mode.

    ```bash
    make qf-run
    ```

## Executables and runtimes

This section describes the project's executables and runtimes and provides step-by-step instructions
 for running a local testnet. This guide is suitable for advanced users.
See [docs/executables_and_runtimes.md](docs/executables_and_runtimes.md).

## Run the Full Node

- To build and run a full node in a container please read instruction [docker/README.md](docker/README.md)
- Please notice a full node does register itself at [https://telemetry.qfnetwork.xyz/](https://telemetry.qfnetwork.xyz/).

## Testing with Zombienet

See [zombienet/README.md](zombienet/README.md).

## Makefile commands

- Build the node: `make qf-node`
- Build the release node: `make qf-node-release`
- Build the node and run it: `make qf-run`
- Build the node and run it with wasm file from `output`: `make qf-run-wasm`
- Build the runtime: `make qf-runtime`
- Linting: `make clippy`
- Formatting: `make fmt`
- Run tests: `make qf-test`
- Check all: `make check`
- Make chain spec: `make qf-chainspec`
