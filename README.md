## Building From Source

> This section assumes that the developer is running on either macOS or Debian-variant operating system. For Windows,
although there are ways to run it, we recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
or a virtual machine.

1. Install Polkadot SDK dependencies following https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/.
1. Clone the repository and build the node binary.

    ```console
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/QuantumFusion-network/qf-solochain.git
    cd qf-solochain
    cargo build --release
    ```

1. Inspect available subcommands.

    ```console
    ./target/release/qf-solochain --help
    ```

1. Run a local node in dev mode.

    ```bash
    make qf-run
    ```

## Run the Full Node

- To build and run a full node in a container please read instruction [docker/README.md](docker/README.md)
- Please notice a full node does register itself at [https://telemetry.qfnetwork.xyz/](https://telemetry.qfnetwork.xyz/).

## Testing with Zombienet

See [zombienet/README.md](zombienet/README.md).

## Compiling Smart Contracts for PolkaVM

First install build tools.

1. Install [Rust toolchain targeting RISC-V RV32E](https://github.com/paritytech/rustc-rv32e-toolchain).
1. Install [bun](https://bun.sh), npm, or yarn to use [Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) to run
   the blockchain node.
1. Install polkatool[^1] (for relinking the standard RV32E ELF to a PolkaVM blob) and chain-spec-builder[^2](for building
   the chain spec from a wasm).

    ```console
    make tools
    ```

To compile a program, run `make pvm-prog-<progname>` where `<progname>` is the name of the program to be compiled. For
example, `make pvm-prog-calc`. The `.polkavm` file will be generated in `output/`.

After that you can use the `make run` to run the node. Then go to UI Polkadot.js and call the extrinsic `qfPolkaVM`.
Then run functions:

- `upload(programBlob)` and upload the `.polkavm` blob
- `execute(a, b, op)` with the two numbers (`a`, `b`) you want to calculate and select the type of operation `op` with 0
- sum, 1 - sub, 2 - mul.

NOTE - you can use the precompiled `qf-pvm-calc.polkavm` blob to test the node. You can find it in the `pvm_prog/precompiled_examples`
folder.

### Testing

For testing compiled polkavm binary blobs use the [qf-test-runner/README.md](qf-test-runner/README.md)

### Troubleshooting

If your compiled `.polkavm` file is not working, try to run `make tools` again that reinstall the tools with `polkatool`
for actual version.

For any compilation errors try to run `make clean` or `rm -rf target` and then try again.

## Makefile commands

- Build the node: `make qf-node`
- Build the release node: `make qf-node-release`
- Build the node and run it: `make qf-run`
- Build the node and run it with wasm file from `output`: `make qf-run-wasm`
- Build the runtime: `make qf-runtime`
- Build the pallet: `make polkavm-pallet`
- Linting: `make clippy`
- Formatting: `make fmt`
- Run tests: `make qf-test`
- Check all: `make check`
- Make chain spec: `make qf-chainspec`
- Make PolkaVM blob: `make pvm-prog-<progname>` where `<progname>` is the name of the program to be compiled. For example
  `make pvm-prog-calc`
- Test the compiled `.polkavm` blob: `make test-pvm-prog-<progname>` where `<progname>` is the name of the compiled
  program. For example `make test-pvm-prog-calc`
