# pallet-claims

This is a vendored copy of the `claim` module from `polkadot/runtime/common` version `polkadot-stable2509-2`, commit: [7304752b47858f2cd601b35d0eb734ad4ccbbc48](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/7304752b47858f2cd601b35d0eb734ad4ccbbc48/polkadot/runtime/common/src/claims)

## Changelog

The following changes have been implemented on top of the vendored copy:

- Claim processing has been modified so that the mint generated by a claim is compensated by a burn from a specified
address. This blocks claims when the compensation holding address does not have sufficient funds and ensures there is no
net change in total issuance after a claim. See https://github.com/QuantumFusion-network/qf-solochain/pull/161.

- A non-root min claim origin has been added in <https://github.com/QuantumFusion-network/qf-solochain/pull/165>.
